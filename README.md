# My Weathe App

Welcome to My Weather App repository! This project is a simple web application that provides real-time weather information for any location. It is a simple Weather Application made by using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## File Descriptions

### `main.html`

This is the main HTML file that structures the webpage. It includes:
- Input fields for the user to enter a location.
- A section to display the fetched weather information.
- Links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

### `script.js`

This JavaScript file handles the core functionality of the app, including:
- Fetching weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) based on user input.

- Dynamically updating the HTML to display the current weather information to the user.
